# Hi! I’m Alejandro 👋 

### It’s great to have you here 
Welcome to this little project of mine, where I share technical know-how, organisational parkour stunts, and the tailwinds and bumps I’ve encountered on my journey to making a positive impact on the products I’ve worked on and the businesses I’ve been part of. You’ll find something valuable here if you’re deep into statistical modeling, obsessed with causal inference, or fascinated by how complex systems tick.

### My work  
Most of my work happens in the dynamic world of online marketplaces, where user behaviour, product design, experimentation, causal inference, and business strategy all collide in interesting ways. From my time at eBay, to working with Adevinta and The Netherlands’ very own Marktplaats, I’ve been tackling a very interesting puzzle: uncovering with what drives these two-sided platforms toward better efficacy, trust, and ultimately, the success of their users.

### This blog
Here, I'll share how I go about turning complex questions into insights that engineers, designers, and executives can actually use. You'll find me writing about this entire process; from identifying the core business questions to proposing product solutions, while exposing the reasoning that connects each step.

There's a lot of good technical content out there. So, my self-set challenge is to add by exploring and sharing the *practical* hurdles and learnings that have emerged in *real* world applications on my end

Finally, about what you all came for, I’ll also dive deep into the tools and frameworks I rely on. Here's a sample, and by no means exhaustive:  
🔄 Causal inference  
🎲 Bayesian modeling  
⚙️ Systems dynamics and simulations  
🔎 Hypothesis testing  
🧪 Advanced experimental designs  

... All applied to topics like pricing, user retention, online trust and survey analysis in online marketplaces.


Stick around!
