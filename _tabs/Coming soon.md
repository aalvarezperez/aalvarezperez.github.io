# Backlog  

Have a ðŸ‘€ at what I plan to write about in the future.  
This list is dynamic and will, of course, outgrow my article writing speed. Whoops.  

Pricing series:
1. Introducing a floor and cap price for transactional services in an online marketplace
2. Price elasticity of demand: optimising our Buyers protection fee

Making Buyer protection mandatory
- case, research and experiment

Foundational stats:
1. Poisson distribution, and modelling daily demand - how I optimised BP fee
2. When Poisson falls short: Negative binomial, and other alternatives
3. Dirichlet distribution and it's use cases in modelling. Bayesian and what else?

Variance reduction techniques (write one by one in depth, then a summary post)
1. Basics: outliers, winsorisation
2. Ranking outcome variable
3. MLRATE, CUPAC

Others
1. bayesian bootstrap
2. Horizontal and Vertical markets: networks of product categories and category specialisation in marketplaces
