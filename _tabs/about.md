Hi! Iâ€™m Alejandro ðŸ‘‹ 
Itâ€™s great to have you here.

Welcome to this little project of mine, where I share technical know-how, organizational parkour stunts, and the tailwinds and bumps Iâ€™ve encountered on my journey to making a positive impact on the products Iâ€™ve worked on and the businesses Iâ€™ve been part of. Youâ€™ll find something valuable here if youâ€™re deep into statistical modeling, obsessed with causal inference, or fascinated by how complex systems tick.

Most of my work happens in the dynamic world of online marketplaces, where user behavior, product design, experimentation, causal inference, and business strategy all collide in interesting ways. From my time at eBay to working with Adevinta (a global online classifieds group) and The Netherlandsâ€™ very own Marktplaats, Iâ€™ve been tackling a very interesting puzzle to me: uncovering what drives these two-sided platforms toward better efficacy, efficiency, trust, and ultimately, the success of their users.

Here, I'll share how I go about turning complex questions into insights that engineers, designers, and executives can actually use. You'll find me writing about this entire process; from identifying the core business questions to proposing product solutions, and exposing my reasoning, data and  that connects each step. Iâ€™ll also dive deep into the tools and frameworks I rely on, from causal inference techniques and Bayesian modeling to systems dynamics and advanced experimental designs. 

My self-set challenge is to keep it real, exploring and sharing the practical hurdles and learnings that emerge along the way. 
Oh, and let's keep learning while we are at it.
