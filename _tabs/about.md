# Hi! I’m Alejandro

Welcome to my website and blog. I share technical know-how on causal inference and experimentation, and organisational parkour stunts that have helped me, and may help you landing the best impact I could for the products and businesses I've worked for. 

You’ll find something valuable here if you’re deep into statistical modeling, causal inference, or by how complex systems tick.

### My work  
Most of my work happens in the dynamic world of online marketplaces, where user behaviour, product design, experimentation, causal inference, and business strategy all collide in interesting ways.
From my time at eBay, to working with Adevinta and The Netherlands’ very own Marktplaats, I’ve been tackling a very interesting puzzle: uncovering with what drives these two-sided platforms toward better efficacy, trust, and ultimately, the success of their users and business.

My [resume](https://aalvarezperez.github.io/resume/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} has a few highlights of my career; the same from which I draw ideas to write about in this blog.


### This blog
Here, I'll share how I go about turning complex questions into insights that engineers, designers, and executives can actually use. You'll find me writing about this entire process; from identifying the core business questions to proposing solutions, and testing them.

There's a lot of good technical content out there. So, my self-set challenge is to add by exploring and sharing the *practical* hurdles and learnings that have emerged in *real* world applications on my end. Further, I primarily write to learn and connect with others; so don't hesitate to share your thoughts, questions and experience with me - through whatever channel you like.

Finally, about what you all came for, here's a sample, though by no means exhaustive, of the themes I plan to write about:  
- Causal inference
- Advanced experimental designs
- Bayesian modeling
- Systems dynamics and simulations
- Hypothesis testing

... All applied to topics like pricing, user retention, online trust and survey analysis.
